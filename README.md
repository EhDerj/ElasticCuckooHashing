## How to run

1) make
2) ./elastic_cuckoo ${#ways} ${size} ${hash_func} ${type} ${scheme} ${occupancy_thr} ${scale_factor} ${swaps}

Parameters:
ways: number of ways/nests
size: size of each way
hash_func: string of the hash function name to be used {city,blake2}
type: type of cuckoo hashtable {elastic, regular}
scheme: resizing method for the elastic cuckoo hashtable {oneshot, dynamic}
occupancy_thr: threshold to trigger resizing 
swaps: number of elements to be rehashed

## Hash functions

1) Blake2 from https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2
2) CityHash from https://github.com/google/cityhash
